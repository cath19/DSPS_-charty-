Higgs Boson:

I used the free extension on this assignment. 
I worked with Theodore Fessaras, Desi Pilla, and Sam Matylewicz. Theodore and I worked on opening the file together. 
I did some of the data wrangling by myself. Desi and Sam did the majority of the rest of the assignment since I was very confused.
