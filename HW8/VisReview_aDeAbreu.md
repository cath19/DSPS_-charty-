Clarity: The plot is somewhat easy to read. However, there is a lot of data being presented
which causes it to be a little cluttered and causes a viewer to take some time it injest and 
understand the overall trends of the data. Some regions of the plot have a higher density of 
data, making it diffuct to distinguish between some data.

Aesthetic: Overall, The colors do work well with each other and are appropriate for color-blindness
when viewing the plot as greyscale, varying marker shapes work well.

Honesty: The data does not seem to be represented dishonestly. 

Suggestions: 
1. Consider using less data by focusing on the monthly cost of avocados, which would help you preserve
the number of cities you chose to investigate and make the  plot less cluttered or consider focusing on two cities that differ most
for a certain quality (certain aspects of population, geographic location,etc.)

2. Consider swapping the colors for the respective data for Denver and Chicago. In high density regions of data,
it can be a little difficult to tell which point belongs to which city (specifically Atlanta and Denver points).

3. Consider using a '.' (dot) for the Philadelphia or Chicago data so they do not have the same shape 
I do see that they have a different orientation, but it might help to avoid any unnessary confusion. 

Quality: I think you did a really good job with differentiating the data by using different colored and shaped
markers. It definitely helped trying to understand such a large amount of data.
Overall, a good plot and a great topic. I love avocados:)
