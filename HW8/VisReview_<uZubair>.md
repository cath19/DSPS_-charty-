## Review
1. The X-axis values are very hard to read.
2. The orange color, which is for Philadelphia, is very difficult to see. The colors should be darker.
3. It is really hard, actually impossible to see what the price per avocado is in let's say 2017-04 for each state. 
So instead of scatter, lines should have been plotted.
